#  1. BUILDING:
#

To distribute applications that use the Intel Cilk Plus language
extensions to non-development systems, you need to build the Intel
Cilk Plus runtime library and distribute it with your application.

To build the libcilkrts.so runtime library component, you need the
autoconf and automake packages, which are available through your
favorite package manager.  You also need a C/C++ compiler that
supports the Intel Cilk Plus language extensions, since the runtime
uses Intel Cilk Plus features internally.  Use either the Intel(R)
C++ Compiler (icc command) v12.1 or later, or in GCC 4.9 or later
(gcc command).

Once you have the necessary prerequisites installed, you can use the
following commands to create the library:

% libtoolize
% aclocal
% automake --add-missing
% autoconf
% ./configure
% make
% make install

This will produce the libcilkrts.so shared object.  To install the
library in a custom location, set the prefix while running the
configure script:

% ./configure --prefix=/your/path/to/lib

It is also possible to use CMake if the above method does not apply
well in your environment. Instruction is available in CMakeLists.txt.

#
#  2. USING:
#

The Intel(R) C++ Compiler will automatically try to bring in the
Intel Cilk Plus runtime in any program that uses the relevant
features.  GCC requires explicit linking of both the library and
its dependencies (libpthread, libdl).  For example:

% gcc foo.c -lcilkrts -lpthread -ldl

#
#  3. DOXYGEN DOCUMENTATION:
#

The library source has Doxygen markup.  Generate HTML documentation
based on the markup by changing directory into runtime and running:

% doxygen doxygen.cfg

#
#  4. QUESTIONS OR BUGS:
#

Issues with the Intel Cilk Plus runtime can be addressed in the Intel
Cilk Plus forums:
http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-cilk-plus/

#
#  5. CONTRIBUTIONS:
#

The Intel Cilk Plus runtime library is dual licensed. The upstream copy
of the library is maintained via the BSD-licensed version available at:
http://cilkplus.org/

Changes to the Intel Cilk Plus runtime are welcome and should be
contributed to the upstream version via http://cilkplus.org/.

Thanks to Tobias Burnus for showing us the magic to make gcc and g++
automatically include the Cilk Plus runtime.
