/**
 * @file record-replay.h
 *
 * @brief record-replay.h and .cpp encapsulate most of the functionality to
 * record and play back a Cilk Plus application.
 *
 * Recording is directed by the setting of the CILK_RECORD_LOG environment
 * variable.  If it's defined, the value specifies the root we'll use to
 * generate files for each worker using the following format string:
 * "%s%d.cilklog", where the integer is the value of w->self.
 *
 * Replay is directed by the setting of the CILK_REPLAY_LOG environment
 * variable, interpreted the same way as CILK_RECORD_LOG.  If both
 * CILK_RECORD_LOG and CILK_REPLAY_LOG are defined, a warning will be given
 * and the attempt to record a log will be ignored.
 *
 * Recording is relatively straightforward.  We write all information about a
 * worker to a per-worker file.
 *
 * Each pedigree record consists of the following fields.  All fields must be
 * present in every record to make parsing easy.
 *    - Type - A string identifying the pedigree record.  See the PED_TYPE_STR_
 *      macros for the currently defined values.
 *    - Pedigree - A string of pedigree values, with underscores between
 *      adjacent values.
 *    - i1 - Record type-specific value.  -1 if not used.
 *    - i2 - Record type-specific value.  -1 if not used.
 *
 * WORKERS record - only written to the file for worker 0.  Note that this is
 * the first worker in the workers array. Worker 0 is the first system worker,
 * *NOT* a user worker.
 *  - Type: "Workers"
 *  - Pedigree: Always "0" - ignored
 *  - i1: Number of workers (g->P) when we recorded the log.  A mismatch when
 *        we attempt to replay the log will result in aborting the execution.
 *  - i2: Log version number - Specified by PED_VERSION in record-replay.cpp
 *
 * STEAL record - written after a successful steal.
 *  - Type: "Steal"
 *  - Pedigree: Pedigree of stolen frame
 *  - i1: Worker the frame was stolen from
 *  - i2: -1
 *
 * SYNC record - written after a worker continues from a sync.
 *  - Type: "Sync"
 *  - Pedigree: Pedigree of sync.  Note that this is the pedigree *before*
 *        the pedigree in incremented in setup_for_execution_pedigree().
 *  - i1: -1
 *  - i2: -1
 *
 * ORPHANED record - saved on a return to a stolen parent.
 *  - Type: "Orphaned"
 *  - Pedigree: Pedigree of the parent frame *before* the pedigree is
 *        incremented by the return
 *  - i1: -1
 *  - i2: -1
 *
 * On replay, the data is loaded into a per-worker array, and the data is
 * consumed in order as needed.
