/********************************************************************
 * THE protocol:
 ********************************************************************/
/*
 * This is a protocol for work stealing that minimizes the overhead on
 * the victim.
 *
 * The protocol uses three shared pointers into the worker's deque:
 * - T - the "tail"
 * - H - the "head"
 * - E - the "exception"  NB: In this case, "exception" has nothing to do
 * with C++ throw-catch exceptions -- it refers only to a non-normal return,
 * i.e., a steal or similar scheduling exception.
 *
 * with H <= E, H <= T.  
 *
 * Stack frames SF, where H <= E < T, are available for stealing. 
 *
 * The worker operates on the T end of the stack.  The frame being
 * worked on is not on the stack.  To make a continuation available for
 * stealing the worker pushes a from onto the stack: stores *T++ = SF.
 * To return, it pops the frame off the stack: obtains SF = *--T.
 *
 * After decrementing T, the condition E > T signals to the victim that
 * it should invoke the runtime system's "THE" exception handler.  The
 * pointer E can become INFINITY, in which case the victim must invoke
 * the THE exception handler as soon as possible.
 *
 * See "The implementation of the Cilk-5 multithreaded language", PLDI 1998,
 * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=277652.277725, for more information
 * on the THE protocol.

/**
 * The invariant on ff->children_reducer_map is that when ff is

 *
 * Consider the two possibilities before resuming execution of ff:
 *
 * 1.  Suppose ff is synched and suspended.  Then either
 *
 *     (a) ff->children_reducer_map stores the reducer map that w
 *         should use, where w is the worker resuming execution of ff, 
 *         OR
 *     (b) w already has a user map, and ff->children_reducer_map is NULL. 
 *
 *     Case (a) happens when we are resuming execution of ff as a
 *     provably good steal.  In this case, w->reducer_map should be
 *     NULL and ff->children_reducer_map is valid.  To resume
 *     execution of ff on w, set w->reducer_map to
 *     ff->children_reducer_map.
 * 
 *     Case (b) occurs when we resume execution of ff because ff is a
 *     called child.  Then, ff->children_reducer_map should be NULL,
 *     and w should already have a valid reducer map when resuming
 *     execution of ff.  We resume execution of ff without changing
 *     w->reducer_map.
 *
 * 2. Suppose frame ff is not synched (i.e., it is active and might have
 *    active children).   Then ff->children_reducer_map is the slot for
 *    storing the reducer map from ff's leftmost child, as in the reducer
 *    protocol.   The runtime may resume execution of ff while it is not 
 *    synched only because of a steal.
 *    In this case, while we are resuming ff, ff->children_reducer_map
 *    may be non-NULL (because one of ff's children has completed).
 *    We resume execution of ff without changing w->reducer_map.

 * @param returning_sf  The stack frame for the spawn helper that is returning.
 *
 * Normally, by the time we gain control in the runtime, the worker
 * has already popped off the __cilkrts_stack_frame "returning_sf"
 * from its call chain.
 * 
 * When we have only serial reductions, w->current_stack_frame is not
 * needed any more, because w is about to enter the runtime scheduling
 * loop anyway.  Similarly, the frame "ff" is slated to be destroyed
 * after the runtime finishes the return from spawn and splices ff out
 * of the tree of full frames.
 *
 * To execute a parallel reduction, however, we still want
 * w->current_stack_frame == returning_sf, and we are going to use the
 * frame ff for a little bit longer.
 *
 * This method:
 *
 *   1. Puts returning_sf back as w's current stack frame.
 *   2. Makes "ff" runnable again on w.

/************************************************************************
  Methods for reducer protocol.

  Reductions occur in two places:
    A. A full frame "ff" is returning from a spawn with a stolen parent.
    B. A full frame "ff" is stalling at a sync.

  To support parallel reductions, reduction functions need to be
  executed while control is on a user stack, before jumping into the
  runtime.  These reductions can not occur while holding a worker or
  frame lock.

  Before a worker w executes a reduction in either Case A or B, w's
  deque is empty.

  Since parallel reductions push work onto the deque, we must do extra
  work to set up runtime data structures properly before reductions
  begin to allow stealing.  ( Normally, when we have only serial
  reductions, once a worker w starts a reduction, its deque remains
  empty until w either steals another frame or resumes a suspended
  frame.  Thus, we don't care about the state of the deque, since w
  will reset its deque when setting up execution of a frame. )

  To allow for parallel reductions, we coerce the runtime data
  structures so that, from their perspective, it looks as though we
  have spliced in an "execute_reductions()" function.  Consider the
  two cases for reductions:

    Case A: Return from a spawn with a stolen parent.
      Consider a spawned function g is returning on a worker w.
      Assume:
          -   g was spawned from a parent function f.  
          -   ff is the full frame for g's spawn helper
          -   sf be the __cilkrts_stack_frame for g's spawn helper.

      We are conceptually splicing "execute_reductions()" so that it
      occurs immediately before the spawn helper of g returns to f.

      We do so by creating two different world views --- one for the
      runtime data structures, and one for the actual control flow.

        - Before reductions begin, the runtime data structures should
          look as though the spawn helper of g is calling
          "execute_reductions()", in terms of both the user stack and
          worker deque.  More precisely, w should satisfy the
          following properties:

              (a) w has ff as its full frame,
              (b) w has sf as its __cilkrts_stack_frame, and
              (c) w has an empty deque. 

          If the runtime satisfies these properties, then if w
          encounters a spawn in a parallel reduction, it can push onto
          a valid deque.  Also, when a steal from w occurs, it will
          build the correct tree of full frames when w is stolen from.

        - In actual control flow, however, once the
          "execute_reductions()" function returns, it is actually
          returning to runtime code instead of g's spawn helper. 

          At the point a worker w began executing reductions, the
          control flow / compiled code had already finished g's spawn
          helper, and w was about to enter the runtime.  With parallel
          reductions, some worker v (which might be different from w)
          is the one returning to the runtime.


      The reduction logic consists of 4 steps:

       A1. Restore runtime data structures to make it look as though
           the spawn helper of g() is still the currently executing
           frame for w.

       A2. Execute reductions on the user stack.  Reductions also
           includes the logic for exceptions and stacks.  Note that
           reductions start on w, but may finish on a different
           worker if there is parallelism in the reduce.

       A3. Splice out ff from the tree of full frames.

       A4. Jump into the runtime/scheduling stack and execute
           "do_return_from_spawn".  This method

           (a) Frees the user stack we were just on if it is no longer needed.
           (b) Decrement the join counter on ff->parent, and tries to do a
               provably good steal.
           (c) Clean up the full frame ff. 


   Case B: Stalling at a sync.

     Consider a function g(), with full frame ff and
     __cilkrts_stack_frame sf.  Suppose g() stalls at a sync, and we
     are executing reductions.

     Conceptually, we are splicing in an "execute_reductions()"
     function into g() as the last action that g() takes immediately
     before it executes the cilk_sync.

     The reduction logic for this case is similar to Case A.

       B1. Restore the runtime data structures. 

           The main difference from Case A is that ff/sf is still a
           frame that needs to be executed later (since it is stalling
           at a cilk_sync).  Thus, we also need to save the current
           stack information into "ff" so that we can correctly resume
           execution of "ff" after the sync.

       B2. Execute reductions on the user stack.

       B3. No frame to splice out of the tree.

       B4. Jump into the runtime/scheduling stack and execute "do_sync".
           This method:
           (a) Frees the user stack we were just on if it is no longer needed.
           (b) Tries to execute a provably good steal.

  Finally, for the reducer protocol, we consider two reduction paths,
  namely a "fast" and "slow" path.  On a fast path, only trivial
  merges of reducer maps happen (i.e., one or both of the maps are
  NULL).  Otherwise, on the slow path, a reduction actually needs to
  happen.
