// Some notes on the stats we are counting for the Cilk Plus runtime. 
//
// INTERVAL_IN_SCHEDULER:
//
//   For a user worker, it starts counting when the worker thread is
//   bound, and stops when the worker thread is unbound.
//
//   For a system worker, it starts counting when the worker thread is
//   created, and stops after it returns from the scheduling loop
//   (which usually won't happen unless __cilkrts_end_cilk() is
//   called.)
// 
// INTERVAL_WORKING + INTERVAL_IN_RUNTIME should be equal to
// INTERVAL_IN_SCHEDULER (modulo overheads in instrumentation).
//
// INTERVAL_IN_RUNTIME tries to count all the time spent inside
// runtime code.  (leave_frame and reudctions blur the accounting a
// bit).  We switch from WORKING to IN_RUNTIME from:
// 
//    1. __cilkrts_leave_frame, when we start doing an exception check
//       and might jump into the runtime, either when returning from a
//       spawn or have an exception to process.
//
//    2. __cilkrts_c_sync, when we are at a sync and the frame has
//       been stolen from.
//
// We switch back to WORKING when we are returning to user code.
// 
// We also switch back to WORKING when we need to do a slow merge of
// reducer maps.  Otherwise, parallel reductions can mess up the stat
// collection.
