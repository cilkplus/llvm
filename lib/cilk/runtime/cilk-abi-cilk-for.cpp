 * Efficiently get the address of the caller's __cilkrts_stack_frame.  The
 * preconditons are that 'w' is the worker at the time of the call and
 * 'w->current_stack_frame' points to the __cilkrts_stack_frame within the
 * spawn helper.  This function should be called only within the argument list
 * of a function that is being spawned because that is the only situation in
 * which these preconditions hold.  This function returns the worker
 * (unchanged) after storing the captured stack frame pointer is stored in the
 * sf argument.
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to get the caller's stack frame in a
 * context where the caller's worker is known but its stack frame is not
 * necessarily initialized.  The "shrink wrap" optimization delays
 * initializing the contents of a spawning function's '__cilkrts_stack_frame'
 * as well as the 'current_stack_frame' pointer within the worker.  By calling
 * this function within a spawning function's argument list, we can ensure
 * that these initializations have occured but that a detach (which would
 * invalidate the worker pointer in the caller) has not yet occured.  Once the
 * '__cilkrts_stack_frame' has been retrieved in this way, it is stable for the
 * remainder of the caller's execution, and becomes an efficient way to get
 * the worker (much more efficient than calling '__cilkrts_get_tls_worker()'),
 * even after a spawn or sync.
