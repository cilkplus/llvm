/**

 * @brief Support for Cilk runtime mutexes.
 *
 * Cilk runtime mutexes are implemented as simple spin loops.
 *
 * This file is similar to a worker_mutex, except it does not have an
 * owner field.
 *
 * TBD: This class, worker_mutex, and os_mutex overlap quite a bit in
 * functionality.  Can we unify these mutexes somehow?
