/**
 * @brief The local_state structure contains additional OS-independent
 * information that's associated with a worker, but doesn't need to be
 * visible to the compiler.
 *
 * No compiler-generated code should need to know the layout of this
 * structure.
 *
 * The fields of this struct can be classified as either local or
 * shared.
 *
 *  Local: This field is only accessed by the thread bound to this
 *    worker struct.  Local fields can be freely accessed without
 *    acquiring locks.
 *  
 *  Shared: This field may be accessed by multiple worker threads.
 *    Accesses to shared fields usually requires locks, except in
 *    special situations where one can prove that locks are
 *    unnecessary.
 *
 * The fields of this can also be classified as "read-only" if the
 * field does not change after it is initialized.  Otherwise, the
 * field is "read/write".  Read-only fields do not require locks to
 * access (ignoring the synchronization that might be needed for
 * initialization if this can occur in parallel).
 *
 * Finally, we explicitly classify some fields as "synchronization"
 * fields if they are used as part of a synchronization protocol in
 * the runtime.  These variables are generally shared and read/write.
 * Mostly, this category includes lock variables and other variables
 * that are involved in synchronization protocols (i.e., the THE
 * protocol).
