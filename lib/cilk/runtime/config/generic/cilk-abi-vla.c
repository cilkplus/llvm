/*
 * Implementation of Variable Length Array (VLA) ABI.
 *
 * The compiler calls these functions to allocate Variable Length Arrays
 * at runtime.  The compiler must guarantee that __cilkrts_stack_free() is
 * called to cleanup any memory allocated by __cilkrts_stack_alloc().
 *
 * This generic implementation always allocates the memory from the heap.
 * Optimally, the implementation should expand the frame of the calling
 * function if possible, since that will be faster.  See the x86 version
 * for one possible implementation.
