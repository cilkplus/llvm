 *
 * Finally, clean up the global state by calling
 * cilkg_deinit_global_state().  This method should be called only
 * after all calls to cilkg_get_global_state() have completed, and
 * while holding the global lock.
 *
 * Before initialization and after deinitialization, the fields in the

 *
 * - "nstacks" - (Not publicly documented at this time, though it may be
