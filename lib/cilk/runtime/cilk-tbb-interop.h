/**
 * @file cilk-tbb-interop.h
 *
 * @brief Interface between TBB and Cilk to allow TBB to associate it's
 * per-thread data with Cilk workers, and maintain the association as work
 * moves between worker threads.  This handles the case where TBB calls
 * into a Cilk function which may later call back to a function making
 * TBB calls.
 *
 * Each thunk structure has two pointers: \"routine\" and \"data\".
 * The caller of the thunk invokes *routine, passing \"data\" as the void*
 * parameter.
