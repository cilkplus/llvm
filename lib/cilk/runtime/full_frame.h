/**
 * @brief A full frame includes additional information such as a join
 * counter and parent frame.
 *
 * The frame at the top of a worker's stack is promoted into a "full"
 * frame, which carries additional information, such as join counter
 * and parent frame.  Full frames can be suspended at a sync, in which
 * case they lie somewhere in memory and do not belong to any
 * worker. 
 *
 * Full frames are in contrast to the entries in the worker's deque which
 * are only represented by a pointer to their __cilkrts_stack_frame.
 *
 * At any instant, we say that a full frame ff is either "suspended",
 * or "owned" by some worker w.
 *
 * More precisely, we say that a worker w owns a frame ff under one of
 * the following conditions:
 *
 *  1. Creation: Worker w has just created ff, but not yet linked ff
 *     into the tree of full frames.  This situation can occur when a
 *     worker is unrolling a call stack to promote a
 *     __cilkrts_stack_frame to a full_frame.
 *  2. Executing frame: We have w->l->frame_ff == ff, i.e,. ff is the
 *     currently executing frame for w.
 *  3. Next frame: We have w->l->next_frame_ff == ff, i.e,. ff is the
 *     next frame that w is about to execute.
 *  4. Resume execution: Worker w has popped ff from
 *     w->l->next_frame_ff, and is about to resume execution of ff.
 *  5. Dying leaf: Worker w has finished executing a frame ff
 *     that is a leaf the tree of full frames, and is in the process
 *     of unlinking "ff" from the tree.
 *
 * Otherwise, the frame ff is suspended, and has no owner.
 * Note that work-stealing changes the owner of a full frame from the
 * victim to the thief.  
 *
 * Using this notion of ownership, we classify the fields of a full
 * frame into one of several categories:
 *
 *  1. Local: 
 *     These fields are accessed only by the owner of the full frame.
 *     Because a frame can have only one owner at a time, these fields
 *     can be modified without any (additional) locking or
 *     synchronization, assuming the correct synchronization for
 *     changing the ownership of full frame (e.g., on a successful
 *     steal) is already in place.
 *
 *  2. Constant (i.e., read-only):
 *     This field is constant for the lifetime of the full frame.
 *     No locks are needed to access this field.
 *     Technically, a field could be read-only and local, but we assume
 *     it is shared.
 *  
 *  3. Self-locked:
 *     To access this field in the frame ff, a worker should acquire
 *     the lock on ff.  
 *     A self-locked field is conceptually "shared" between the worker
 *     that owns frame ff (which is a child) and the worker that
 *     owns the frame ff->parent (which is the parent of ff).
 *
 *  4. Parent-locked:
 *     To access this field in the frame ff, a worker should
 *     acquire the lock on ff->parent.
 *     A parent-locked field is conceptually "shared" between the worker
 *     that owns frame ff, and a worker that is either owns the
 *     parent frame (ff->parent) or owns a sibling frame of ff (i.e.,
 *     any child of ff->parent).
 *
 *  5. Synchronization
 *     A field used explicitly for synchronization (i.e., locks).

 *   2. Resume stolen frame at begining of continuation
 *   3. Suspend stolen frame at a sync
 *   4. Resume frame (no longer marked stolen) after the sync
 *
 * When the frame is suspended (steps 1 and 3), __cilkrts_put_stack is called to
 * establish the stack pointer for the sync.  When the frame is resumed (steps
 * 2 and 4), __cilkrts_take_stack is called to indicate the stack pointer
 * (which may be on a different stack) at
 * the point of resume.  If the stack pointer changes between steps 2 and 3,

 * (The above is a changeable implementation detail.  The resume, sequence, in
 * particular, is more complex on some operating systems.)
