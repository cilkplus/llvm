   These are in-progress notes for the upcoming Clang 3.9 release. You may

   <http://llvm.org/releases/3.7.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_.

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 3.9. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <http://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please check out the main `Clang Web Site
<http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <http://llvm.org>`_.

What's New in Clang 3.9?
========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed here.
Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying infrastructure
are described first, followed by language-specific sections with improvements
to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features
------------------

- Feature1...

- On Windows targets, some uses of the ``__try``, ``__except``, and
  ``__finally`` language constructs are supported in Clang 3.7. MSVC-compatible
  C++ exceptions are not yet supported, however.

- Clang 3.7 fully supports OpenMP 3.1 and reported to work on many platforms,
  including x86, x86-64 and Power. Also, pragma ``omp simd`` from OpenMP 4.0 is
  supported as well. See below for details.

- Clang 3.7 includes an implementation of :doc:`control flow integrity
  <ControlFlowIntegrity>`, a security hardening mechanism.


Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------

Clang's diagnostics are constantly being improved to catch more issues,
explain them more clearly, and provide more accurate source information
about them. The improvements since the 3.7 release include:

- -Wmove is a new warning group which has the previous two warnings,
  -Wredundant-move and -Wpessimizing-move, as well as previous warning
  -Wself-move.  In addition, this group is part of -Wmost and -Wall now.

- -Winfinite-recursion, a warning for functions that only call themselves,
  is now part of -Wmost and -Wall.

- -Wobjc-circular-container prevents creation of circular containers, 
  it covers ``NSMutableArray``, ``NSMutableSet``, ``NSMutableDictionary``,
  ``NSMutableOrderedSet`` and all their subclasses.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

The option ....

In addition, ``[[deprecated]]`` is now accepted as a synonym for Clang's
existing ``deprecated`` attribute.

- ``objc_boxable`` attribute was added. Structs and unions marked with this attribute can be
  used with boxed expressions (``@(...)``) to create ``NSValue``.

Profile Guided Optimization
---------------------------

Clang now accepts GCC-compatible flags for profile guided optimization (PGO).
You can now use ``-fprofile-generate=<dir>``, ``-fprofile-use=<dir>``,
``-fno-profile-generate`` and ``-fno-profile-use``. These flags have the
same semantics as their GCC counterparts. However, the generated profile
is still LLVM-specific. PGO profiles generated with Clang cannot be used
by GCC and vice-versa.

Clang now emits function entry counts in profile-instrumented binaries.
This has improved the computation of weights and frequencies in
profile analysis.

OpenMP Support
--------------
OpenMP 3.1 is fully supported, but disabled by default. To enable it, please use
the ``-fopenmp=libomp`` command line option. Your feedback (positive or negative) on
using OpenMP-enabled clang would be much appreciated; please share it either on
`cfe-dev <http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev>`_ or `openmp-dev
<http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/openmp-dev>`_ mailing lists.

In addition to OpenMP 3.1, several important elements of the 4.0 version of the
standard are supported as well:

- ``omp simd``, ``omp for simd`` and ``omp parallel for simd`` pragmas
- atomic constructs
- ``proc_bind`` clause of ``omp parallel`` pragma
- ``depend`` clause of ``omp task`` pragma (except for array sections)
- ``omp cancel`` and ``omp cancellation point`` pragmas
- ``omp taskgroup`` pragma

Internal API Changes
--------------------

These are major API changes that have happened since the 3.6 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

-  Some of the ``PPCallbacks`` interface now deals in ``MacroDefinition``
   objects instead of ``MacroDirective`` objects. This allows preserving
   full information on macros imported from modules.

-  ``clang-c/Index.h`` no longer ``#include``\s ``clang-c/Documentation.h``.
   You now need to explicitly ``#include "clang-c/Documentation.h"`` if
   you use the libclang documentation API.

Static Analyzer
---------------

* The generated plists now contain the name of the check that generated it.

TLS is enabled for Cygwin defaults to -femulated-tls.


* New check for dereferencing object that the result of a zero-length
  allocation.

* Also check functions in precompiled headers.

* Properly handle alloca() in some checkers.

* Various improvements to the retain count checker.


clang-tidy
----------
Added new checks:

* google-global-names-in-headers: flag global namespace pollution in header
  files.

* misc-assert-side-effect: detects ``assert()`` conditions with side effects
  which can cause different behavior in debug / release builds.

* misc-assign-operator-signature: finds declarations of assign operators with
  the wrong return and/or argument types.

* misc-inaccurate-erase: warns when some elements of a container are not
  removed due to using the ``erase()`` algorithm incorrectly.

* misc-inefficient-algorithm: warns on inefficient use of STL algorithms on
  associative containers.

* misc-macro-parentheses: finds macros that can have unexpected behavior due
  to missing parentheses.

* misc-macro-repeated-side-effects: checks for repeated argument with side
  effects in macros.

These are major API changes that have happened since the 3.8 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

AST Matchers
------------

...

* readability-else-after-return: flags conditional statements having the
  ``else`` branch, when the ``true`` branch has a ``return`` as the last statement.

* readability-redundant-string-cstr: finds unnecessary calls to
  ``std::string::c_str()``.

* readability-shrink-to-fit: replaces copy and swap tricks on shrinkable
  containers with the ``shrink_to_fit()`` method call.

* readability-simplify-boolean-expr: looks for boolean expressions involving
  boolean constants and simplifies them to use the appropriate boolean
  expression directly (``if (x == true) ... -> if (x)``, etc.)

SystemZ
-------

* Clang will now always default to the z10 processor when compiling
  without any ``-march=`` option. Previous releases used to automatically
  detect the current host CPU when compiling natively. If you wish to
  still have clang detect the current host CPU, you now need to use the
  ``-march=native`` option.

* Clang now provides the ``<s390intrin.h>`` header file.

* Clang now supports the transactional-execution facility and
  provides associated builtins and the ``<htmintrin.h>`` and
  ``<htmxlintrin.h>`` header files. Support is enabled by default
  on zEC12 and above, and can additionally be enabled or disabled
  via the ``-mhtm`` / ``-mno-htm`` command line options.

* Clang now supports the vector facility. This includes a
  change in the ABI to pass arguments and return values of
  vector types in vector registers, as well as a change in
  the default alignment of vector types. Support is enabled
  by default on z13 and above, and can additionally be enabled
  or disabled via the ``-mvx`` / ``-mno-vx`` command line options.

* Clang now supports the System z vector language extension,
  providing a "vector" keyword to define vector types, and a
  set of builtins defined in the ``<vecintrin.h>`` header file.
  This can be enabled via the ``-fzvector`` command line option.
  For compatibility with GCC, Clang also supports the
  ``-mzvector`` option as an alias.
 
* Several cases of ABI incompatibility with GCC have been fixed.


Last release which will run on Windows XP and Windows Vista
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is expected to the be the last major release of Clang that will support
running on Windows XP and Windows Vista.  For the next major release the
minimum Windows version requirement will be Windows 7.
